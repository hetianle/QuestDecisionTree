**QuestDecisionTree** is an open source software project for training decision classification tree with Quest
algorithm proposed by Loh and Shih (1997) and stands for Quick, Unbiased, Efficient, Statistical Tree.
It is a tree-structured classification algorithm that yields a binary decision tree. A comparison study of QUEST
and other algorithms was conducted by Lim et al (2000).  The project was implemented with c++ language ,trained and 
tested successfully.

**Dependencicy

Before you run the program, you need some libraries intalled in your machine. 

g++

gsl 

cmake


**Installation

'cd /../QuestDecisionTree'

'mkdir build'

'cd build'

'cmake ../'

'make'

'./QuestDecisionTree'
